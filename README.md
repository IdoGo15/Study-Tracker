# zoom-tracker

Zoom-Tracker is my first project using Angular. I developed the app in response to a problem I had during the academic studies semester - tracking my viewing content in Zoom.
The app allows the user to track his viewing content in Zoom - add, edit and delete courses and lectures.
In addition, I made it fit for mobile view as well as web.

Demo: [https://zoom-tracker.netlify.app/](https://zoom-tracker.netlify.app/)
